# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a clustering model for Netflix content using various data science techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to categorize Netflix movies and TV shows to enhance content discovery and recommendation.

## Key Steps in the Project

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed movie distributions, ratings, country-specific content, and more.

### Feature Engineering and NLP

- **Textual Data Processing**: Applied NLP techniques to process and optimize textual data for clustering.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created relevant features from the dataset for better clustering performance.

### Clustering Model Implementation

- **Libraries Used**: scikit-learn, Seaborn
- **Optimal Clusters Determination**: Used the elbow method and silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Clustering Algorithm**: Implemented K-means clustering for enhanced content categorization.
